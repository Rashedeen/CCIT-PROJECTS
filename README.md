# Digicamp Network Simulation

## Project Overview
This project involved simulating a network infrastructure for Digicamp, a digital skills training provider. The goal was to implement and configure a network system across three building floors, integrating routers, switches, PCs, access points, and a server, while applying network services such as DHCP, static IP assignment, and a web server.

## Project Steps

### 1. Network Topology Design
- Created a three-floor network topology.
- Deployed core devices: routers, switches, access points, PCs, laptops, and a server.
- Assigned network addressing schemes using both DHCP and static IPs based on different sections.
